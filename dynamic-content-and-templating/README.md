# What we're doing in this Module

## Managing data without a database

## Render Dynamic Content in our Views

## Understanding Templating Engines
 - HTMLish template that contains all of the css, js, and html, with some blanks
 - Replaces  placeholders and snippets with html content that is generated
 - The result is a html file that isn't hard coded that is sent to the users

    ### EJS
    - <p> <%= name%> </p>
